### ⚠️ Note on Project Scope
This project is a **prototype** created primarily to explore the implementation of **raw WebSockets (`ws` module)** without the abstraction of modern libraries like Socket.io. As the focus was on core protocol logic, comprehensive error handling has not been implemented.
